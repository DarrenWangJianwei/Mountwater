        "Victoria Square is a well-performing shopping centre due to its outstanding location and synergistic balance of products and services. The Property is able to further capitalize on the strong features of the market as well as the property itself by taking advantage of value-add opportunities. The current marketing program and building signage can be improved upon to potentially increase both traffic and sales. Long term redevelopment potential is also available, as the Property is located in an Urban Corridor that is targeted by the City for densified residential/mixed-use development. ",
